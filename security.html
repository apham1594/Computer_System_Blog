    <h4  ><strong><i>Computer Viruses</i></strong></h4>
    <ol>Perhaps the most well-known computer security threat, a computer virus is a program 
        written to alter the way a computer operates, without the permission or kn ptimum defense against online threats. 
        But, as we'll say again and again in this post, the single most-effective way of fending off viruses 
        is up-to-date antivirus software from a reputable provider. </ol>

    <h4><strong><i>Spyware Threats</i></strong></h4>

    <ol>A serious computer security threat, spyware is any program that monitors your online activities or 
        installs programs without your consent for profit or to capture personal information. 
        Weâ€™ve amassed a wealth of knowledge that will help you combat spyware threats and stay safe online.                                  </ol>
    <ol>While many users won't want to hear it, reading terms and conditions is a good way to build an 
        understanding of how your activity is tracked online. And of course, if a company you don't 
        recognize is advertising for a deal that seems too good to be true, be sure you have an internet 
        security solution in place and click with caution.</ol>

    <h4><strong><i>Phishing</i></strong></h4>

    <ol>Masquerading as a trustworthy person or business, phishers attempt to steal sensitive financial 
        or personal information through fraudulent email or instant messages. Phishing attacks are some 
        of the most successful methods for cybercriminals looking to pull off a data breach. 
        Antivirus solutions with identity theft protection can be "taught" to recognize phishing 
        threats in fractions of a second. </ol>

    <h4><strong><i>Hackers and Predators</i></strong></h4>

    <ol>People, not computers, create computer security threats and malware. Hackers and predators are 
        programmers who victimize others for their own gain by breaking into computer systems to steal, 
        change, or destroy information as a form of cyber-terrorism. These online predators can compromise 
        credit card information, lock you out of your data, and steal your identity. As you may have guessed, 
        online security tools with identity theft protection are one of the most effective ways to protect 
        yourself from this brand of cybercriminal.</ol>
